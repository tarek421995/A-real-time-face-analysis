## Installation

First, clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to the cloned directory. Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


### Additional Notes

1. **Comments in Code**: Ensure your code is well-commented to help others understand how it works.

2. **Requirements File**: It's good practice to include a `requirements.txt` file with all the necessary Python packages. You can generate this file using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

3. **License**: Decide on a license for your project. The MIT license is a common choice, but you should choose the one that best fits your project.

4. **.gitignore File**: If there are files you don't want to push to GitHub (like local configuration files, Python bytecode files, etc.), add them to a `.gitignore` file.

5. **Sample Outputs**: If possible, include screenshots or videos of your project in action in the README file.

After setting up your README and description, you can push your code to the repository. Make sure to commit often and write clear, descriptive commit messages.
